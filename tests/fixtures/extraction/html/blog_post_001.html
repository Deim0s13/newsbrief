            <p>After two decades of using macOS as my primary development environment, I finally made the switch to Linux full-time. This wasn't an impulsive decision—it was the result of growing frustrations and a realization that my needs had changed significantly over the years.</p>

            <h2>The Breaking Point</h2>

            <p>The catalyst came last fall when Apple released yet another macOS update that broke several of my development tools. I spent an entire weekend wrestling with compatibility issues, environment variables, and permission problems that didn't exist before the update. This wasn't the first time, but it was the final straw.</p>

            <p>I realized I was spending more time fighting my operating system than actually writing code. The walled garden approach that once felt like protection now felt like a cage.</p>

            <h2>Why Linux?</h2>

            <p>The decision to try Linux came down to several factors:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Control</strong> - I wanted to understand and control every aspect of my system</li>
                <li><strong>Stability</strong> - No more surprise updates breaking my workflow</li>
                <li><strong>Performance</strong> - My older hardware runs significantly faster</li>
                <li><strong>Philosophy</strong> - I believe in open source software</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Transition</h2>

            <p>I started by dual-booting Ubuntu on my secondary machine. The modern Linux desktop experience was nothing like I remembered from my brief experiments years ago. Everything just worked—WiFi, Bluetooth, external displays, even sleep and wake cycles.</p>

            <p>Within a month, I had migrated all my development projects to the Linux machine. The Docker experience was noticeably better (native containers!), compilation times improved, and I discovered a wealth of tools I never knew existed.</p>

            <h2>What I Miss</h2>

            <p>To be fair, there are things I miss about macOS:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Preview.app was genuinely excellent</li>
                <li>iMessage integration with my phone</li>
                <li>The trackpad gestures were smoother</li>
                <li>Some commercial software isn't available on Linux</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>Six months in, I have no regrets. My productivity has increased, my frustration has decreased, and I've learned more about computing in this period than in the previous five years. Linux isn't for everyone, but for developers willing to invest some time in learning, the rewards are substantial.</p>

            <p>If you're considering making the switch, my advice is to start with a dual-boot setup and give yourself time to adapt. The learning curve is real, but it's also surprisingly gentle with modern distributions.</p>
