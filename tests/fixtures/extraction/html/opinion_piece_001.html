        <p>As artificial intelligence continues to reshape the labor market, we must seriously reconsider our social safety nets. The evidence is mounting that automation will displace workers faster than new jobs can be created, at least in the short to medium term.</p>

        <p>Universal Basic Income, once dismissed as a fringe idea, deserves another look. The concept is straightforward: provide every adult citizen with a regular cash payment, no strings attached. This would establish a floor below which no one could fall.</p>

        <h2>The Economic Argument</h2>

        <p>Critics often claim UBI is unaffordable. However, when we factor in the savings from consolidating existing welfare programs, reducing administrative overhead, and the economic stimulus from increased consumer spending, the numbers become more favorable.</p>

        <p>A modest UBI of $1,000 per month for all adults would cost approximately $2.8 trillion annually. This sounds enormous, but consider that we already spend over $1 trillion on various welfare programs, many of which create perverse incentives and bureaucratic waste.</p>

        <h2>Dignity and Freedom</h2>

        <p>Beyond economics, UBI addresses a fundamental question of human dignity. In a society where meaningful work may become scarce, how do we ensure everyone can participate fully? UBI provides the freedom to pursue education, care for family members, volunteer, or start businesses without the fear of destitution.</p>

        <h2>Pilot Programs Show Promise</h2>

        <p>Results from pilot programs in Finland, Kenya, and several US cities have been encouraging. Recipients generally didn't stop working—they worked smarter. They invested in skills, took better jobs rather than desperate ones, and improved their mental health.</p>

        <h2>The Path Forward</h2>

        <p>I propose a phased implementation starting with a $500 monthly payment, funded initially by a combination of carbon taxes, financial transaction taxes, and gradual consolidation of existing programs. This cautious approach allows for adjustment while building political support.</p>

        <p>The AI revolution is coming whether we're ready or not. UBI offers a humane way to ensure its benefits are widely shared rather than concentrated among those who own the machines. The time for serious debate is now.</p>
