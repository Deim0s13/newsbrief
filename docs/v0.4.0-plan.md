## Features to Implement

### 1. Skim/Detail View Toggle
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Epic**: UI

**Description**: Allow users to switch between two reading modes:
- **Skim Mode**: Compact view showing only titles and metadata (topic, source, date)
- **Detail Mode**: Full view with AI summaries, bullets, and "why it matters"

**Implementation**:
- Add toggle button in the toolbar (eye icon or list/grid icons)
- Store preference in localStorage
- Update CSS to show/hide summary sections based on mode
- Maintain performance for large article lists

**Files to Modify**:
- `app/templates/index.html` - Add toggle UI
- `app/static/js/app.js` - Toggle logic and localStorage
- `app/static/css/custom.css` - Skim mode styles

---

### 2. Dark Mode Toggle
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Epic**: UI

**Description**: Implement dark/light theme switching with system preference detection.

**Implementation**:
- Add moon/sun icon toggle in navigation
- Detect system preference on first load
- Store user preference in localStorage
- Use Tailwind dark mode utilities (already in templates)
- Smooth transitions between themes

**Files to Modify**:
- `app/templates/base.html` - Add toggle button in nav
- `app/static/js/app.js` - Dark mode toggle logic
- Verify existing `dark:` classes work correctly

**Note**: Templates already use Tailwind's `dark:` classes, so most of the work is already done!

### 3. Keyboard Shortcuts
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Epic**: UI

**Description**: Add vim-style keyboard navigation for power users.

**Shortcuts**:
- `j` / `k` - Navigate down/up through articles
- `o` / `Enter` - Open selected article in new tab
- `r` - Refresh articles
- `/` - Focus search box
- `s` - Star/save article (future feature)
- `?` - Show keyboard shortcuts help modal
- `Esc` - Clear selection/close modals

**Implementation**:
- Add global keydown event listener
- Implement visual selection state (highlight selected article)
- Prevent conflicts with text input fields
- Add help modal showing all shortcuts
- Store keyboard nav preference in localStorage

**Files to Modify**:
- `app/static/js/app.js` - Keyboard event handling
- `app/templates/index.html` - Help modal
- `app/static/css/custom.css` - Selection highlight styles

---

### 4. Visual Feedback & Loading States
**Priority**: Low  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Epic**: UI

**Description**: Polish the UX with better loading indicators and transitions.

**Improvements**:
- Skeleton loaders for article cards during initial load
- Progress indicator during refresh
- Toast notifications for actions (feed added, refresh complete)
- Smooth transitions for view changes
- Error states with retry options

**Files to Modify**:
- `app/templates/_items.html` - Skeleton loader template
- `app/static/js/app.js` - Loading state management
- `app/static/css/custom.css` - Animation styles
