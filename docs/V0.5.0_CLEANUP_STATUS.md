# v0.5.0 Release - Cleanup Status

**Date**: 2025-11-18  
**Purpose**: Address tidy-up tasks before finalizing v0.5.0 and moving to v0.6.0

---

## 📋 Tasks

### ✅ 1. README Features Section - **COMPLETE**

**Issue**: Features section listed "Current (v0.5.3)" with old article-centric RSS aggregator approach  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

**Changes Made**:
- Reorganized Features section to highlight **Story-Based Aggregation (v0.5.0)** as primary feature
- Moved RSS feed management, AI processing, and Web Interface to supporting sections
- Updated version labels from "v0.5.3" to "v0.5.0"
- Emphasized story-first architecture throughout

---

### ⚠️ 2. Version Numbering & GitHub Releases - **NEEDS CLARIFICATION**

**Issue**: GitHub Releases shows v0.5.4, but we just created v0.5.0 tag

**Current Git Tags** (in order):
```
v0.3.1
v0.3.2
v0.3.3
v0.3.4
v0.3.5
v0.3.5.1
v0.5.0  ← Just created (latest)
v0.5.2
v0.5.3
v0.5.4  ← User says this is showing in GitHub Releases
```

**Problem**: v0.5.0 was created AFTER v0.5.2, v0.5.3, v0.5.4 - this is out of order

**Questions for User**:
1. **What happened to v0.5.1?** Was it skipped?
2. **When were v0.5.2-v0.5.4 created?** Were these interim releases during Story Architecture development?
3. **What should be the "official" v0.5.0 release?**
   - Option A: Delete v0.5.2-v0.5.4 tags and make v0.5.0 the only/final release
   - Option B: Rename current v0.5.0 to v0.5.5 to maintain chronological order
   - Option C: Keep all tags, document v0.5.0-v0.5.4 as the "v0.5 series" with v0.5.4 as latest

**Recommended Action**: **Option A** - Clean slate
- Delete tags v0.5.2, v0.5.3, v0.5.4 (they may have been dev/testing tags)
- Keep v0.5.0 as the official Story Architecture release
- Update GitHub Releases to show v0.5.0 as latest

### 🔍 3. GitHub Actions Failures - **IN PROGRESS**

**Current CI/CD Workflows**:
1. **`ci-cd.yml`**: Main pipeline (test → build → security-scan → deploy)
2. **`dependencies.yml`**: Weekly dependency updates + security audit
3. **`project-automation.yml`**: GitHub Project sync (DISABLED - manual only)
4. **`gitops-deploy.yml`**: Reusable deployment workflow (generates K8s manifests)

**Status**: Need to check which workflows are actually failing

**Common Causes**:
- Test failures in `test_models.py` or `test_story_crud.py`
- Linter issues (black, isort, mypy)
- Security scan findings (Trivy, pip-audit)
- Super-Linter validation errors

**Action Needed**:
- Run tests locally to verify they pass
- Check formatting with black/isort
- Review any linter errors

---

### 🚀 4. Green Deployments - **CLARIFICATION NEEDED**

**Current Deployment Setup**:
- Deployments in `ci-cd.yml` are **simulated** (echo commands, not real deployments)
- Workflows generate K8s manifests but don't actually deploy to clusters
- This is **expected** for a self-hosted project without live staging/prod infrastructure

**Deployment Jobs**:
1. **deploy-dev**: Triggers on push to `dev` branch
2. **deploy-staging**: Triggers on push to `main` branch  
3. **deploy-prod**: Triggers on GitHub Release

**Questions for User**:
1. **Do you have actual deployment infrastructure?** (K8s cluster, VM, etc.)
2. **What does "green deployments" mean in this context?**
   - Option A: CI/CD workflows should complete successfully (even if simulated)
   - Option B: Actual deployments to real infrastructure
   - Option C: Just documentation of deployment process

**Current Status**: If Option A, then deployments should already be "green" when pushed to `dev`/`main`. If Option B, need to configure actual deployment targets.

### 📚 5. Feature Branch Workflow for v0.6.0 - **DOCUMENTED**

**Status**: ✅ Already documented in `docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md`

**Workflow Summary**:
1. **Create feature branches from `dev`**: `git checkout -b feature/issue-XX-description`
2. **Work and commit**: Use conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.)
3. **Create PR to `dev`**: Review and merge feature → dev
4. **Release PR to `main`**: When milestone complete, PR dev → main
5. **Tag release**: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"`

**For v0.6.0**: Follow this workflow strictly
- All features developed in `feature/*` branches
- Merge to `dev` for integration testing
- Only merge `dev` → `main` for final releases

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Version Numbering**: User decision on v0.5.0 vs v0.5.4 tags
2. **Check CI/CD**: Run workflows or check GitHub Actions tab to see what's failing
3. **Clarify Deployments**: Understand what "green deployments" means for this project

### Before Moving to v0.6.0:
1. Resolve version numbering issue
2. Ensure all CI/CD workflows pass
3. Update GitHub Releases to reflect correct version
4. Document any deployment procedures if real infrastructure exists
5. Switch to feature branch workflow

## 📝 Notes

**Git History**:
- Most recent commits on `main`:
  - `cf78d8c` - docs: update documentation for v0.5.0 release
  - `e7b4182` - feat: implement scheduled story generation  
  - `30688e2` - fix: load supporting articles on story detail page

**Branching**:
- `main` and `dev` are currently synchronized after merge
- Ready to begin feature branch workflow for v0.6.0

**Release Strategy**:
- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- v0.5.0 = Story Architecture (major feature)
- v0.6.0 = Enhanced Intelligence (next major feature set)
- v0.5.x = Bug fixes and minor improvements to v0.5.0

**Status**: Awaiting user input on version numbering and deployment clarification before proceeding.
