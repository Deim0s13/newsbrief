### `DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT.md`
**Archived**: 2025-11-12  
**Reason**: Audit complete - all discrepancies resolved  
**Status**: Historical - working document used to identify and fix documentation inconsistencies

This was a one-time audit that found 7 major discrepancies across documentation files (README.md, STORY_ARCHITECTURE_BACKLOG.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, ADR 0002). All issues have been resolved and documentation is now consistent.
